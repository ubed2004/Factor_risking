ü§ñ AI-Powered Health Risk Profiler
====================================
üìú1.Overview
--------------------------
This project is a sophisticated backend service designed to analyze lifestyle survey responses and generate a comprehensive health risk profile. It leverages a powerful pipeline that accepts either image-based surveys (via OCR) or direct JSON text/object input, processes the data through Google's Gemini AI for multi-step analysis, and returns a structured JSON report.

The core functionalities include data extraction from images, a data quality guardrail, risk factor identification, risk classification with a numerical score, and the generation of personalized, actionable recommendations. The entire service is exposed as a REST API built with Node.js and Express, making it easy to integrate with any frontend application or testing tool.

        ],
        "status": "ok"
    }
}
```
‚ùåError Response ( ```400 Bad Request ```)
------------------
If more than 3 fields are missing or empty in the input, the server will respond with an error.
```
Example Body:

    "error": "OCR text is missing multiple expected fields.",
    "missingFields": [
        "smoker",
        "exercise",
        "diet",
        "sleep"
    ]
}

```
üß†6.AI Prompt
------------------
The core of the analysis is controlled by the system prompts sent to the Google Gemini API.

Prompt 1: Get Risk Factors
Used to summarize the user's input into professional phrases.
```
"You are a health data summarizer. For each lifestyle habit provided, identify the key factor and describe it in a clear, professional phrase (e.g., 'High sugar intake', 'Lack of physical activity'). You must summarize every category provided. Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object with a single key, 'risk_factors', which is a list of these summary strings."
```
Prompt 2: Risk Classification
Used to generate a score and risk level.
```
"You are a health risk classification engine. Your task is to analyze a list of lifestyle factors. Based on these factors, you must calculate a numerical score between 0 and 95, determine an overall risk_level ('low', 'medium', 'high'), and provide a rationale (a list of the primary factors). Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object with the keys risk_level, score, and rationale."
```
Prompt 3: Get Recommendations
Used to generate the final report and advice.
```
"You are an expert health analyst. Your task is to analyze a user's survey responses. Based on the data, you must determine an overall risk_level, list the key factors, provide a simple recommendation for each factor, and set a status field to 'ok'. Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object with the keys risk_level, factors, recommendations, and status."
